https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/facb4260-be10-45fe-a715-0bc1b1463422

## Features

- **Configurable**: Customize summary length, AI models, and exclusion rules
- **Simple and Seamless**: Summaries are added directly to the top of your note
- **Multiple AI Providers**: Currently supports Ollama; with llama.cpp, LMStudio etc. coming soon.

## Prerequisites

Local inference through ollama is the first supported method and recommended - this assures your private notes don't leave your machine.

### Ollama

1. Install Ollama from [https://ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai)
2. Pull the default model: `ollama pull gemma3:4b`
3. Ensure Ollama is running: `ollama serve`

NOTE: Gemma3:4b is a leading option for quality/size at the time of this writing. You can however use any model.
